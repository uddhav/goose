:::tip CLI Providers
CLI providers are cost-effective alternatives that use your existing subscriptions. They work differently from API providers as they execute CLI commands and integrate with the tools' native capabilities. See the [CLI Providers guide](/docs/guides/cli-providers) for detailed setup instructions.

## Using Custom OpenAI Endpoints

Goose supports using custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, which is particularly useful for:
- Self-hosted LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) using vLLM or KServe
- Private OpenAI-compatible API servers
- Enterprise deployments requiring data governance and security compliance
- OpenAI API proxies or gateways

### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes | Authentication key for the API |
| `OPENAI_HOST` | No | Custom endpoint URL (defaults to api.openai.com) |
| `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` | No | Organization ID for usage tracking and governance |
| `OPENAI_PROJECT` | No | Project identifier for resource management |
| `OPENAI_CUSTOM_HEADERS` | No | Additional headers to include in the request. Can be set via environment variable, configuration file, or CLI, in the format `HEADER_A=VALUE_A,HEADER_B=VALUE_B`. |

### Example Configurations

## Using Goose for Free

Goose is a free and open source AI agent that you can start using right away, but not all supported [LLM Providers][providers] provide a free tier. 

Below, we outline a couple of free options and how to get started with them.

:::warning Limitations
These free options are a great way to get started with Goose and explore its capabilities. However, you may need to upgrade your LLM for better performance.
:::


### Groq
Groq provides free access to open source models with high-speed inference. To use Groq with Goose, you need an API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).

Groq offers several open source models that support tool calling:
- **moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct** - Mixture-of-Experts model with 1 trillion parameters, optimized for agentic intelligence and tool use
- **qwen/qwen3-32b** - 32.8 billion parameter model with advanced reasoning and multilingual capabilities  
- **gemma2-9b-it** - Google's Gemma 2 model with instruction tuning
- **llama-3.3-70b-versatile** - Meta's Llama 3.3 model for versatile applications

To set up Groq with Goose, follow these steps:

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
  **To update your LLM provider and API key:**

### Local LLMs

Goose is a local AI agent, and by using a local LLM, you keep your data private, maintain full control over your environment, and can work entirely offline without relying on cloud access. However, please note that local LLMs require a bit more set up before you can use one of them with Goose.

:::warning Limited Support for models without tool calling
Goose extensively uses tool calling, so models without it can only do chat completion. If using models without tool calling, all Goose [extensions must be disabled](/docs/getting-started/using-extensions#enablingdisabling-extensions).
:::

Here are some local providers we support:

<Tabs groupId="local-llms">

        1. [Download Ramalama](https://github.com/containers/ramalama?tab=readme-ov-file#install).
        2. In a terminal, run any Ollama [model supporting tool-calling](https://ollama.com/search?c=tools) or [GGUF format HuggingFace Model](https://huggingface.co/search/full-text?q=%22tools+support%22+%2B+%22gguf%22&type=model):

          The `--runtime-args="--jinja"` flag is required for Ramalama to work with the Goose Ollama provider.

          Example:

          ```sh
          ramalama serve --runtime-args="--jinja" ollama://qwen2.5

          If you notice that Goose is having trouble using extensions or is ignoring [.goosehints](/docs/guides/using-goosehints), it is likely that the model's default context length of 2048 tokens is too low. Use `ramalama serve` to set the `--ctx-size, -c` option to a [higher value](https://github.com/containers/ramalama/blob/main/docs/ramalama-serve.1.md#--ctx-size--c).

    2. [Enable Docker Model Runner](https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/#enable-dmr-in-docker-desktop)
    3. [Pull a model](https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/#pull-a-model), for example, from Docker Hub [AI namespace](https://hub.docker.com/u/ai), [Unsloth](https://hub.docker.com/u/unsloth), or [from HuggingFace](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-model-runner-on-hugging-face/)

    Example:

    ```sh
    docker model pull hf.co/unsloth/gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf:q6_k

    │  https://api.openai.com (default)

    The default value for the host-side port Docker Model Runner is 12434, so the `OPENAI_HOST` value could be: 
    `http://localhost:12434`.

    ```
    ◆  Provider OpenAI requires OPENAI_BASE_PATH, please enter a value

## Azure OpenAI Credential Chain

Goose supports two authentication methods for Azure OpenAI:

1. **API Key Authentication** - Uses the `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` for direct authentication
2. **Azure Credential Chain** - Uses Azure CLI credentials automatically without requiring an API key

To use the Azure Credential Chain:
- Ensure you're logged in with `az login`
- Have appropriate Azure role assignments for the Azure OpenAI service
