# Supported LLM Providers

Goose is compatible with a wide range of LLM providers, allowing you to choose and integrate your preferred model.

:::tip Model Selection
Goose relies heavily on tool calling capabilities and currently works best with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI's GPT-4o (2024-11-20) model.
[Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard][function-calling-leaderboard] can be a good guide for selecting models.

## Using Custom OpenAI Endpoints

Goose supports using custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, which is particularly useful for:
- Self-hosted LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) using vLLM or KServe
- Private OpenAI-compatible API servers
- Enterprise deployments requiring data governance and security compliance
- OpenAI API proxies or gateways

### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes | Authentication key for the API |
| `OPENAI_HOST` | No | Custom endpoint URL (defaults to api.openai.com) |
| `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` | No | Organization ID for usage tracking and governance |
| `OPENAI_PROJECT` | No | Project identifier for resource management |

### Example Configurations

<Tabs groupId="deployment">
  <TabItem value="vllm" label="vLLM Self-Hosted" default>
    If you're running LLaMA or other models using vLLM with OpenAI compatibility:
    ```sh
    OPENAI_HOST=https://your-vllm-endpoint.internal
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-internal-api-key
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kserve" label="KServe Deployment">
    For models deployed on Kubernetes using KServe:
    ```sh
    OPENAI_HOST=https://kserve-gateway.your-cluster
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-kserve-api-key
    OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=your-org-id
    OPENAI_PROJECT=ml-serving
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="enterprise" label="Enterprise OpenAI">
    For enterprise OpenAI deployments with governance:
    ```sh
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
    OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=org-id123
    OPENAI_PROJECT=compliance-approved
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Using Goose for Free

Goose is a free and open source AI agent that you can start using right away, but not all supported [LLM Providers][providers] provide a free tier. 

Below, we outline a couple of free options and how to get started with them.

:::warning Limitations
These free options are a great way to get started with Goose and explore its capabilities. However, you may need to upgrade your LLM for better performance.
:::


### Google Gemini
Google Gemini provides a free tier. To start using the Gemini API with Goose, you need an API Key from [Google AI studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

To set up Google Gemini with Goose, follow these steps:

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI" default>
    1. Run: 
    ```sh
    goose configure
    ```
    2. Select `Configure Providers` from the menu.
    3. Follow the prompts to choose `Google Gemini` as the provider.
    4. Enter your API key when prompted.
    5. Enter the Gemini model of your choice.

    ```

    2. Select `Provider Settings` from the menu.
    2. Choose `Google Gemini` as provider from the list.
    3. Click Edit, enter your API key, and click `Set as Active`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Local LLMs (Ollama)

Ollama provides local LLMs, which requires a bit more set up before you can use it with Goose.

1. [Download Ollama](https://ollama.com/download). 
2. Run any [model supporting tool-calling](https://ollama.com/search?c=tools):

:::warning Limited Support for models without tool calling
Goose extensively uses tool calling, so models without it (e.g. `DeepSeek-r1`) can only do chat completion. If using models without tool calling, all Goose [extensions must be disabled](/docs/getting-started/using-extensions#enablingdisabling-extensions). As an alternative, you can use a [custom DeepSeek-r1 model](/docs/getting-started/providers#deepseek-r1) we've made specifically for Goose.
:::

Example:

```sh
ollama run qwen2.5
```

3. In a separate terminal window, configure with Goose:

```sh
goose configure
```

4. Choose to `Configure Providers`

```
┌   goose-configure 
│
◆  What would you like to configure?
│  ● Configure Providers (Change provider or update credentials)
│  ○ Toggle Extensions 
│  ○ Add Extension 
└  
```

5. Choose `Ollama` as the model provider

```
┌   goose-configure 
│
◇  What would you like to configure?

│
◆  Which model provider should we use?
│  ○ Anthropic 
│  ○ Databricks 
│  ○ Google Gemini 
│  ○ Groq 
│  ● Ollama (Local open source models)
│  ○ OpenAI 
│  ○ OpenRouter 
└  
```

5. Enter the host where your model is running

:::info Endpoint
For Ollama, if you don't provide a host, we set it to `localhost:11434`. When constructing the URL, we preprend `http://` if the scheme is not `http` or `https`. If you're running Ollama on port 80 or 443, you'll have to set `OLLMA_HOST=http://host:{port}`

### DeepSeek-R1

Ollama provides open source LLMs, such as `DeepSeek-r1`, that you can install and run locally.
Note that the native `DeepSeek-r1` model doesn't support tool calling, however, we have a [custom model](https://ollama.com/michaelneale/deepseek-r1-goose) you can use with Goose. 

:::warning
Note that this is a 70B model size and requires a powerful device to run smoothly.
:::


1. Download and install Ollama from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/download).
2. In a terminal window, run the following command to install the custom DeepSeek-r1 model:

```sh
ollama run michaelneale/deepseek-r1-goose
